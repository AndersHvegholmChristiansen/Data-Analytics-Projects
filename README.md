# Project Background

DKFLOW is a fictional Danish e-commerce company operating a nationwide order fulfillment network across multiple product categories. The business has experienced steady growth over recent years, accompanied by increasing operational complexity and rising expectations for delivery performance. This project analyzes order flow, delivery outcomes, and product performance using descriptive dashboards to provide management with a clear overview of operational performance.

# Project Goals
- Provide a consolidated overview of order volume and delivery performance over time
- Identify underperforming regions and cities based on delivery targets
- Understand how order flow is distributed across order statuses and product categories
- Assess year over year performance trends across key product categories

# Data Structure Overview
The analysis is based on data representing customers, orders, products, and payments within the e-commerce business. The dataset covers multiple years of transaction activity and supports analysis of performance across time, geography, and product categories. Key data components include:
- Order Data: Order timing, status, and delivery information used to analyze order flow and delivery performance.
- Customer Data: Customer and regional attributes supporting geographic performance analysis.
- Product Data: Product categories and attributes that enables assessing product mix and performance trends.
- Payment Data: Order-level payment values enabling revenue and order value analysis.

Data cleaning and transformations were performed with power Query in Power BI to support consistent aggregation and dashboard-based analysis.
